# demuxFQ
Flexibly demultiplex Fastq files

This package contains "demuxFQ", a program for demultiplexing Fastq files generated by Illumina's sequencers (or any other Fastq in a sufficiently similar format).  The user provides a sample sheet (describing the indices in the Fastq, and the required output filenames) and a Fastq file, then the program generates the demultiplexed files.

The package may also be used to inspect a Fastq file without a sample sheet, reporting the indices found.

## Sample Sheets

"demuxFQ" reads a sample sheet that describes the expected barcodes in the Fastq file.  The format of a line in the sample sheet is:
> XXXXXXXX filename

Or if the file has dual indices:
> XXXXXXXX YYYYYYYY filename

where "XXXXXX" and "YYYYYY" are barcode sequences, and "filename" is the name of the file to which to write sequences matching this barcode (pair).  The white space separating the tokens may be spaces or tabs.

## Features to add

* Check for IO errors
* Validate number of saved, lost reads against input total.
  * fast: just check the sums on exit.
  * slow (optional): re-read files, count reads.
